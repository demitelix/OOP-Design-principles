Used patterns:

    Singleton pattern (Creational)
        - creating single object like Call Center, Director
        
    Facade pattern (Structural)
        - Hide from client all order creating steps
        
    Adapter pattern (Structural)
        - Receive complete delivery order time instead just creating time
